Brain tumors demand early detection for effective treatment, but relying on manual diagnosis via MRI scans is time-consuming and prone to error. The need to effectively and accurately identify brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is paramount for patient care and survival rates. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in medical imaging, particularly deep learning, to assess the effectiveness of previously trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) models in accurately identifying and classifying brain tumors. Our goal is to determine suitable algorithms for this critical diagnostic task.

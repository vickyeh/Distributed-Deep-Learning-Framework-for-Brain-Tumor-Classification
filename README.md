# Distributed Deep Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Classification

## Introduction

Brain tumors demand early detection for effective treatment, but relying on manual diagnosis via MRI scans is time-consuming and prone to error. The need to effectively and accurately identify brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is paramount for patient care and survival rates. 

In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in medical imaging, particularly deep learning, to assess the effectiveness of previously trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) models in accurately identifying and classifying brain tumors. Our goal is to determine suitable algorithms for this critical diagnostic task.

## Methodology

This study effectively demonstrates the application of deep learning models, particularly:

- Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks
- Vision Transformers

for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using MRI images.

## Results

Our experiments reveal that models like **VGG19** and **ResNet50** offer robust performance and high accuracy, proving to be valuable in the medical imaging domain. Despite facing challenges such as:

- Limited computational resources, which particularly affected the Vision Transformerâ€™s performance, our findings are promising. 

## Conclusion

Overall, we anticipate our findings will contribute to brain tumor diagnostics, providing rapid, accurate insights that can assist healthcare professionals and inform treatment decisions, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
